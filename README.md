Test projects from thinking big.

## Notes:
In this repository you will find solutions for both question one and three.
I was not able to start on question 2 (Battleship) this is because I was unfamiliar with
APS.NET code and had to researched in order to get everything running as specified in the document.

### Question One:
##### File Name: Triplet
I was able to complete the program as requested. But didn't get the testing working fully.
I also noticed while I was testing that the output for question one is different from mine. the document say "You Like" appears 3 time, but I have only found it occurring 2 times.

To run the application you should be able to run it in the Visual Studio. Its a simple C# form application you will be able to input any string and it should output the results at the bottom.

##### Total Time: 5.5 hours

### Question 3:
##### File Name: GitHub
was the first I started with, because I was unfamiliar with it. But that lead for little time for the other questions.
I was able to get the information from Github using Octokit. This allowed me to get the information for the user.
The information is not all displayed on the screen.

To run the application all you will need is to open the solution inside Visual Studio, once its running you should be able to enter the username in the first slug in the URL. like this https://localhost:32000/haacked

##### Total Time: 2.5 hours
